# WIP

Softwares have been arranged innovatively to enable easy searching. Each software in database has its own page we call Software Page. Each such Software Page has information about software arranged in cards we call Information Cards.

## Currently Software Page contains following Information Cards:

* Title
* Short Info
* Download
* Description
* System Requirements
* Developers
* Initial release
* Repository
* Programming Language
* Operating System
* Categories
* License
* Social Presence
* Source

Suggest a missing Information Card by opening an issue. Feel free to choose Information Card template.
