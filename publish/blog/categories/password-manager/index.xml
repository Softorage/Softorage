      <description>KeePass is a free and open-source password manager primarily for Windows, with official support for macOS and Linux operating systems through the use of Mono. There are also unofficial ports for Windows Phone, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices.
It stores usernames, passwords, and other fields, including free-form notes and file attachments, in an encrypted file. This file can be protected by any combination of a master password, a key file, and the current Windows account details.</description>
