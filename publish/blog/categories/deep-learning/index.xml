      <description>Apache MXNet is an open source multi-language machine learning (ML) library especially to train and deploy deep neural networks, on a wide array of devices. Once embedded in the host language, it blends declarative symbolic expression with imperative tensor computation. It is built on a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient.</description>

      <description>Apache SystemML is a machine learning system with support for Java 8+, Scala 2.11+, Python 2.7/3.5+, Hadoop 2.6+, and Spark 2.1+. It provides a workplace for machine learning using big data. As It runs on top of Apache Spark, it automatically scales data, line by line, determining whether the code should be run on the driver or an Apache Spark cluster. Future releases may include additional deep learning with GPU capabilities such as importing and running neural network architectures and pre-trained models for training.</description>

      <description>OpenNN (Open Neural Networks Library) implements neural networks, a main area of deep learning research.
OpenNN implements data mining methods as a bundle of functions. It allows embedding functions in other software tools using an &amp;lsquo;Application Programming Interface (API)&amp;rsquo; for the interaction between the software tool and the predictive analytics tasks. A graphical user interface (GUI) is still missing, but some functions can support the integration of specific visualization tools.</description>

      <description>PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing. One can also reuse Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.
 PyTorch provides two high-level features:
 Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system - README.md on GitHub repo    Automatic differentiation is done with a tape-based system at both a functional and neural network layer level.</description>
