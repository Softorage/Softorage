  Apache MXNet is an open source multi-language [machine learning (ML)](/categories/machine-learning) library especially to train and deploy deep [neural networks](/categories/neural-networks), on a wide array of devices. Once embedded in the host language, it blends declarative symbolic expression with imperative tensor computation. It is built on a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. It offers auto differentiation to derive gradients. MXNet is computation and memory efficient and runs on various heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices to distributed GPU clusters.
