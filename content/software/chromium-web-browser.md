  Chromium is an open-source [web browser](/categories/web-browser) project by Google that forms the basis for [Google Chrome](/software/google-chrome). While [Chrome](/software/google-chrome) is based on Chromium, Google also adds a number of proprietary features to [Chrome](/software/google-chrome) like automatic updates and support for additional video formats. The Chromium source code is also widely used by other parties to create their own browsers, in a similar manner as Google, while others simply build it as-is and release browsers with the Chromium name. Some of the other [web browsers](/categories/web-browser) based on Chromium are, [Microsoft Edge](/software/microsoft-edge), [Vivaldi](/software/vivaldi-web-browser) and [Brave](/software/brave-web-browser).
