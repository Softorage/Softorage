  Malwarebytes is an [antivirus](/categories/antivirus/) software that scans for and removes malicious software, including rogue security software, adware, and spyware. It scans in batch mode, rather than scanning all files opened, reducing interference if another on-demand anti-malware software is also running on the computer. 
  
  The free version can be run manually by the user when desired, whereas the paid version can perform scheduled scans, automatically scan files when opened, block IP addresses of malicious web sites, and scan only those services, programs and device drivers that are currently in use.
