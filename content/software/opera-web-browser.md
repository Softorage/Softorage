  Opera is a freeware [web browser](/categories/web-browser) developed by Opera Software. Opera is a [Chromium](/software/chromium-web-browser/)-based browser using the Blink layout engine.
  
  Opera was conceived at Telenor as a research project in 1994 and was bought by Opera Software in 1995. It was a commercial software for the first ten years and had its own proprietary Presto layout engine. The Presto versions of Opera received many awards, but Presto development ended after a milestone transition to [Chromium](/software/chromium-web-browser/) in 2013.
  
  Privacy: In 2016, Opera was sold to a group of Chinese companies and investors. According to its privacy policy, Opera collects data on its users, including names, IP addresses and search terms. It also reserves the right to share that data with third-party applications but doesn’t give specifics. The company that operates the VPN service for Opera, SurfEasy, essentially collects everything it can from users, including browsing history, IP address and bandwidth usage while using the VPN. One can turn off some data collection by disabling certain features in the settings.
