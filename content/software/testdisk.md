  TestDisk is an open source [data recovery](/categories/data-recovery/) [utility](/categories/utility/) that runs exclusively from the command-line interface and allows users to check and undelete partitions from a given disk drive. It is primarily designed to help recover lost data storage partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again; when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally erasing a partition table). It can also be used to collect detailed information about a corrupted drive.
