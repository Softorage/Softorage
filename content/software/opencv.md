  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source [computer vision](/categories/computer-vision) and [machine learning](/categories/machine-learning) software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for [computer vision](/categories/computer-vision) applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
  
  > It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

  OpenCV supports the [deep learning](/categories/deep-learning) frameworks [TensorFlow](/software/tensorflow/), [Torch](/software/torch/)/[PyTorch](/software/pytorch/) and [Caffe](/software/caffe/).
