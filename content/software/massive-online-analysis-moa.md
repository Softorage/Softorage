  MOA (Massive Online Analysis) is an open source framework for [data stream mining](/categories/data-mining) including [machine learning](/categories/machine-learning) algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems and tools for evaluation. MOA is written in Java and relates to [WEKA](/software/weka/) project.
  
  MOA allows to build and run experiments of [machine learning](/categories/machine-learning) or [data mining](/categories/data-mining) on evolving data streams. It is also possible to use [WEKA](/software/weka/) classifiers from MOA, and MOA classifiers and streams from [WEKA](/software/weka/).
