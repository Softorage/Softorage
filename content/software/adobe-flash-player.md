  Adobe Flash Player (labeled Shockwave Flash in [Internet Explorer](/software/internet-explorer/) and [Firefox](/software/mozilla-firefox/)) is computer software for using content created on the Adobe Flash platform, including viewing multimedia contents, executing rich Internet applications, and streaming audio and video. Flash Player can run from a [web browser](/categories/web-browser/) as a [browser plug-in](/categories/browser-extension/) or on supported mobile devices. Flash Player runs SWF files that can be created by Adobe Flash Professional, Adobe Flash Builder or by third party tools such as FlashDevelop. Flash Player supports [vector graphics](/categories/vector-graphics-editor/), [3D graphics](/categories/3d-computing-graphics/), embedded audio, video and [raster graphics](/categories/raster-graphics-editor), and a scripting language called ActionScript (based on ECMAScript).
