  OpenCog is a project that aims to build an open source [artificial intelligence](/categories/artificial-intelligence) framework. OpenCog Prime is an architecture for robot and virtual embodied cognition that defines a set of interacting components designed to give rise to human-equivalent [artificial general intelligence (AGI)](/categories/artificial-intelligence) as an emergent phenomenon of the whole system. OpenCog Prime's design is primarily the work of Ben Goertzel while the OpenCog framework is intended as a generic framework for broad-based AGI research. Research utilizing OpenCog has been published in journals and presented at conferences and workshops including the annual Conference on [Artificial General Intelligence](/categories/artificial-intelligence). OpenCog is released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  OpenCog is in use by more than 50 companies, including Huawei and Cisco.
