  uTorrent is an efficient [BitTorrent client](/categories/bittorrent-client) from the originator of the BitTorrent protocol. Most of the features present in other BitTorrent clients are present in uTorrent, including bandwidth prioritization, scheduling, RSS auto-downloading, and Mainline DHT. Additionally, uTorrent supports the protocol encryption joint specification and peer exchange.
  
  uTorrent claims to not eat away at valuable system resources; the program typically runs on approx. 6MB of memory.
