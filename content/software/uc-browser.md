  UC Browser is a [web browser](/categories/web-browser/) developed by the Singapore/China-based mobile Internet company UCWeb, which is in turn owned by the Alibaba Group. It uses [Chromium browser](/software/chromium-web-browser/) as its base. It is more popular than [Google Chrome](/software/google-chrome/) in some of Asia's fastest-growing markets like India and Indonesia.
  
  The browser uses cloud acceleration and data compression technology. UC Browser's servers act as a proxy which compresses and renders web pages before sending them to users. This process helps to load web content faster. The browser can adapt to some network environments and support multi-file format downloading. In addition, UC Browser has HTML5 web app and cloud syncing features. It also has a feature called "fast download", which downloads a file in multiple parts simultaneously.
  
  There have been [privacy concerns regarding UC Browser as at 2015](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/05/a-chatty-squirrel-privacy-and-security-issues-with-uc-browser/).
