  The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit—previously known as CNTK—is an open-source toolkit for commercial-grade distributed [deep learning](/categories/deep-learning). It describes [neural networks](/categories/neural-networks) as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. 
  
  The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit enables to leverage the information within massive data-sets through [deep learning](/categories/deep-learning) by providing scaling, speed, and accuracy with commercial-grade quality and compatibility with the programming languages and algorithms already in use.
