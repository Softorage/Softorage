  Vivaldi is a freeware, cross-platform [web browser](/categories/web-browser/) developed by Vivaldi Technologies, a company founded by [Opera](/software/opera-web-browser/) Software co-founder and former CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner and Tatsuki Tomita. It is based on [Chromium](/software/chromium-web-browser/) [web browser](/categories/web-browser/), which uses Blink browser engine and V8 JavaScript engine. It is available for general users but is primarily targeted towards technically-inclined users as well as former [Opera](/software/opera-web-browser/) users disgruntled by its transition from the Presto layout engine to a [Chromium](/software/chromium-web-browser/)-based browser. Despite also being [Chromium](/software/chromium-web-browser/)-based, Vivaldi aims to revive the features of the Presto-based [Opera](/software/opera-web-browser/) with its own proprietary modifications.
