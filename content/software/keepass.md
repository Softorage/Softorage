  KeePass is a free and open-source [password manager](/categories/password-manager/) primarily for Windows, with official support for macOS and Linux operating systems through the use of Mono. There are also unofficial ports for Windows Phone, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices.
  
  It stores usernames, passwords, and other fields, including free-form notes and file attachments, in an encrypted file. This file can be protected by any combination of a master password, a key file, and the current Windows account details. By default, the KeePass database is stored on a local file system (as opposed to cloud storage). 
  
  It supports use of plugins. It has a password generator and synchronization function, supports two-factor authentication, and a Secure Desktop mode. It can use a two-channel auto-type obfuscation feature to offer additional protection against keyloggers. It can import from over 30 other most commonly used password managers.
