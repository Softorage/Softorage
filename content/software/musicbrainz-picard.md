  MusicBrainz Picard is a free and open-source [tag editor](/categories/tag-editor) for identifying, tagging, and organizing digital audio recordings.
  
  It allows to clean local musics and songs by automatically updating artist, album, track information and album art cover for each song.
  
  MusicBrainz is an open source database of music. The MusicBrainz Picard tool uses this database to identify and tag a song. It checks the songs against the MusicBrainz database to see if it can find a match. MusicBrainz Picard is an [acoustic fingerprinter](/categories/acoustic-fingerprinter), so if it canâ€™t find a match, it uses AcoustID (a database of audio fingerprints) in order to figure out the song.
