  > IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. IPython provides the following features:
  > 
  >  * Interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based)
  >  * A browser-based notebook interface with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other media
  >  * Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits
  >  * Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into one's own projects
  >  * Tools for parallel computing
