  Evince is a [document viewer](/categories/document-viewer) for PDF, PostScript, DjVu, TIFF, XPS and DVI formats. It was designed for the GNOME desktop environment. The developers of Evince intended to replace the multiple GNOME document viewers with a single and simple application. The Evince motto sums up the project aim: "Simply a Document Viewer". GNOME releases have included Evince since GNOME 2.12 (September 2005). Evince code consists mainly of C, with a small part (the code that interfaces with Poppler) written in C++. A large number of Linux distributions – including Ubuntu, Fedora and Linux Mint – include Evince as the default document-viewer. Evince is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License version 2 or later. The Evince FAQ highlights the meaning of the word "Evince" as "to show or express something clearly".
