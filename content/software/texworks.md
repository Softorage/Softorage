  TeXworks is free and open-source [TeX editor](/categories/tex-editor), available for Windows, Linux and OS X, released under GPL v2.
  
  > It is a Qt-based graphical user interface to the TeX typesetting system and its LaTeX, ConTeXt, and XeTeX extensions. TeXworks is targeted at direct generation of PDF output. It has a built-in PDF viewer using the poppler library; the viewer has auto-refresh capability, and also features SyncTeX support (which allows the user to synchronize the PDF viewer position with the source, and vice versa with a single click). \- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TeXworks&oldid=875136087)
