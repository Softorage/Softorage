We want to build a database that would contain every software that one can ever imagine of. A database accessible to everyone on the web alike. We want there to be an information resource to cater to any software related information needs of people. A resource, which people can look up to, which people can love. If you want there to exist a massive database of softwares accessible to everyone, you can help us build it!
