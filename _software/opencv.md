description: |
  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source [computer vision](/search/?category=computer_vision) and [machine learning](search/?category=machine_learning) software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for [computer vision](/search/?category=computer_vision) applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
  
  > It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.
  > \- [Official website](https://opencv.org/)
  
  OpenCV supports the [deep learning](/search/?category=deep_learning) frameworks TensorFlow, Torch/PyTorch and Caffe.
