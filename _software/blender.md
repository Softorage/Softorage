# 17 'source': 
# {10 Initial Release} Sources for information shall be included wherever relevant. In case some information has been used from a source such as a website or a book, website address or its URL in case of website and book name in case of book (and page number from such book, if feasible, on which information may be found) may be treated as source.
# {9 Developer, 11 Repository} If information is existent truth, such as name of developer for which a source may not be found, in such case, website address of the developer and social presence such as Wikipedia page if any may be treated as source. In case website of such developer mentions the software, then URL of such website page would be preffered over simple website address of developer.
# {7 Description} In case information has been gathered from multiple sources, such multiple sources shall be mentioned. In case of Description taken from a collaborative work such as Wikipedia, URL of such (Wikipedia) page from which such information is taken and any sources mentioned on such (Wikipedia) page with regard to information used therefrom, may be treated as source.
# {14 Categories} Currently softwares are categorised as they are on Wikipedia to make sense and ensure uniformity. Also as softwares may be categorised differently using a different logic, categories may not necessarily conform with those present on Wikipedia in near future. So, mentioning source for categories is optional.
# {18 Rating} URL of website where rating can be found or page number of book along with name of book if rating is taken from a book, shall be treated as source. Source shall be as much specific as feasible.
# Usually reviews are found to be of two types, viz, Professional's review (say Editor's review) and user's reviews. Assuming Professional's review and user's reviews can co-exist at one reviewing entity as well, seperate provision for such case has been made. It has been assumed that one rating can be obtained from one source only, hence there can only be one source attributable to one rating; that is, one based on Professional's and one based on user reviews. Source for rating is to be entered as an array.
# In case the rating is based on reviewing entity's Professional's review, format for source is ["name of reviewer","e","url of source"]. In case a rating doesn't have 'num' attribute, such rating is taken to be Professional's review.
# In case the rating is based on a number of user reviews, format for source is ["name of reviewer","u","url of source"]. In case a rating has 'num' attribute, such rating is taken to be based on a number of user's review.
# source for desktop platforms shall be under dskp, smartphone or tablet under smptb, and others under else. Array can contain multiple sources.

# 18 'rating': Ratings and Reviews - See if any of the given sites has review for the current software.
# Currently a policy of showing reviews from trusted sites is followed. In case, you want to insert review from a site that is not listed, please open an issue for inclusion of the site in the list. In such case, it shall be ensured that reviewing site is trustable. Trustability of a reviewing site may be ensured by study of policies of such site, its reviewing mechanism, its age, whether it is well established, or such other matters.
# 'name' is where you specify the name of the reviewing entity.
# 'rate' is an array with format as [rating, out of].
# Sometimes some entities ask users for reviews and average them to arrive at one rating. 'num' is the number of reviews upon which the rating by the entity is based. Some entities review softwares by asking professional reviewers (say Editor's review), in which case 'num' may not hold relevance. In such case 'num' shall be omitted.
