  Orange is a component structured [data mining](/search#data_mining) as well as [machine learning](/search#machine_learning) software suite written in python language. It's a [data visualization](/search#data_visualization) as well as evaluation software, with regard to novice and experts alike. [Data mining](/search#data_mining) can be done via visual programming or even python scripting.
  
  Orange components are called widgets. Widgets cover a wide variety, ranging from simple [data visualization](/search#data_visualization), subset selection, and pre-processing, to empirical evaluation of learning algorithms and predictive modeling. Orange is used for [data analysis](/search#data_analysis) as well.
